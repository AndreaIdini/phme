**Detachment**  
_solitudine, crescita, letteratura, insegnare._

> How are you to imagine anything if the images are always provided for you? Doublethink: To deliberately believe in lies, while knowing they're false. Examples of this in everyday life: "Oh, I need to be pretty to be happy" [...] So to defend ourselves, and fight against assimilating this dullness into our thought processes, we must learn to read.

Insegnare come vita, il distacco come cura, il contatto come salvezza.
